To end this a-bit-bitter post, I'm quoting this article: https://lnkd.in/fnYeQdA - "The Purpose of Life Is Not Happiness, It’s Usefulness"

"For you it can be painting, creating a product, helping elderly, or anything you feel like doing.

Don’t take it too seriously. Don’t overthink it. Just DO something that’s useful. Anything." - Darius Foroux
